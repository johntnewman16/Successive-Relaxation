# Successive-Relaxation

In this project, I simulated the potentials in a MOSFET transistor using inital conditions, boundary conditions finite difference equations that govern charge flow. The overall idea is to continually update the potentials in the transistor until the difference between the a points potential and its surrounding grid points reach an acceptable threshold.
